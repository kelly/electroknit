# Electroknit

A javascript library for knitting machines. Currently works with [knitic](http://www.knitic.com) boards. Future plans to support OpenKnit and other platforms. 

## Install

````bash
$ npm install electroknit -g
````

## Usage

```bash
$ electroknit -i 'test.jpg' -o 100 -d 
````

## App

I've built an Electron app to use with this module that makes it easy to visualize your knitting process. (Coming Soon!)
